# Portfolio – Kim Kindvall

Welcome!  
This repository is a collection of my personal and academic projects that explore everything from **software engineering and simulation** to **machine learning, AI, and web design**.

This is the repository version of my portfolio, that I created to keep information and snapshots in one place for my own convenience. [Click here](https://bbykimchi.github.io/) to see the website version of my portfolio.
